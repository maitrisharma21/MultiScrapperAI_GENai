# ðŸ§  Multiscrapper AI
Multiscrapper AI is an intelligent content extraction and question-answering system that leverages advanced language models and web scraping techniques to help users interact with information from multiple content sourcesâ€”PDFs, web pages, and YouTube videosâ€”using natural language queries.

# ðŸš€ Features
Multi-source Input Support:

-> PDF Documents: Upload any PDF, and the system extracts and processes its content. Ask questions and get answers based on the PDF using Ollama 3.

-> Web URLs: Input any webpage URL. The scraper uses Bright Data proxies to bypass CAPTCHAs and IP blocks, parses the webpage content using BeautifulSoup, and uses Ollama 3 to provide insightful answers.

-> YouTube Videos: Provide a YouTube video URL. The system fetches the transcript, processes the content, and uses Gemini 4.0 Flash to answer questions based on the video content.

Integrated with Generative AI Models:

-> Ollama 3 for document and webpage Q&A.

-> Gemini 4.0 Flash for video content analysis and summarization.

Seamless Parsing & Proxy Handling:

-> Robust handling of CAPTCHA and geo-restrictions via Bright Data proxy network.

-> Clean and efficient parsing of raw HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
